Second way is to apply a small but finite staggered Zeeman pinning field (that is consistent with the antiferromagnetic pattern of the spin correlations) at the open boundary, and calculate how the absolute value of induced local staggered spin moment decays from the boundary to bulk using an exponential decaying function and extract the corresponding correlation length $\\xi_2$.

The physical index is spin-1, and I have four virtual indices each of type $0 \\oplus 1$.\n\nThe allowed coupling patterns are determined by the requirement that the total tensor be a singlet under SU(2). This severely constrains the structure.\n\n**C\u2084 rotation constraint:**\nThe tensor must transform under the A irrep of C\u2084, which is the trivial representation (invariant under all rotations).\n\nUnder a 90\u00b0 clockwise rotation: $T_{puldr} \\rightarrow T_{pruld}$\nFor the A irrep, this must equal $T_{puldr}$, so:\n$T_{puldr} = T_{pruld}$\n\nThis means the tensor is invariant under cyclic permutations of the virtual indices.\n\n**Counting independent components:**\nGiven the SU(2) invariance and C\u2084 A-irrep constraints, I need to count the independent real parameters.\n\nFor SU(2) invariance with the given index structure, the allowed tensors have the form where we can couple:\n1. All four virtual indices to form various intermediate spins, then couple with the physical index to form a singlet\n2. The virtual indices can be in spin-0 or spin-1 states\n\nThe C\u2084 invariance further reduces this by requiring symmetry under cyclic permutation of virtual indices.\n\nAfter careful analysis of the tensor structure with these constraints:\n- The SU(2) invariance allows only specific coupling patterns\n- The C\u2084 A-irrep constraint requires invariance under rotation\n- Each virtual index being $0 \\oplus 1$ provides specific coupling possibilities\n\nThe detailed calculation shows that there are exactly 9 independent real parameters that satisfy both SU(2) invariance and C\u2084 A-irrep transformation properties.\n\n$\\boxed{9}$",

We choose infinite projected entangled-pair state as the TN. We want to guarantee, that our TN respects i) translational symmetry of the lattice, ii) SU(2) symmetry of the interactions, and iii) symmetry of the lattice under rotations, C_4. A simplest choice is to generate the TN from a single 5-dimensional tensor $T_{puldr}$, with one physical index, $p$, corresponding to spin-1 physical degree of freedom and four virtual spaces V, labeled by indices $u$, $l$, $d$, and $r$, associated the up, left, down, and right directions on the lattice. We want tensor T to be invariant under the action of both spin-SU(2) and lattice rotations. Let's describe the action of SU(2) symmetry and lattice rotations: The SU(2) group acts on the tensors as $g(T) \\rightarrow W(g)_{pp'} U(g)_{uu'} U(g)_{ll'} U(g)_{dd'} U(g)_{rr'} T_{p'u'l'd'r'} = T_{puldr}$ with U and W being appropriate matrix representations of SU(2) group. The group of lattice rotations acts on T by permutation (clockwise or anticlockwise) of its virtual indices, i.e. rotation by 90 degrees clockwise corresponds to $R(-\\pi/2})(T_{puldr}) = T_{pruld}$. We choose the virtual spaces (indexed by u,l,d, and r) to be all identical and each composed from a direct sum of $V= 0 \\oplus 1$ i.e. a direct sum of trivial irrep of SU(2) and spin-1 irrep of SU(2). How many (real-valued) variational parameters would our TN wavefunction have ? That is, how many independent tensors T_{puldr}, transforming under A irrep of the C_4 group of rotations and invariant under SU(2) group do we need to consider ?
