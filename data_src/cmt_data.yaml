- prompt: 'Consider a spinful electron system in a two-dimensional triangular lattice.

    We want to study the commensurate charge density wave in real space at half-filling
    per site, induced by Coulomb repulsion denoted by $U_0$, $U_1$ for the onsite
    and nearest-neighbor interaction.

    In the strong coupling limit, where the Coulomb energy scale is much larger than
    the hopping parameter between sites.

    What is the ground state energy per site?

- prompt: "We are interested in counting fully packed dimer configurations on honeycomb\
    \ lattice.\nDimer can be placed on any of the nearest-neighbor bonds of the lattice\
    \ and each site has to be \na member of exactly one dimer.\nThis is one of the\
    \ ways to count ground state configurations of classical antiferromagnetic Ising\
    \ \nmodel on triangular lattice. In particular, we want to consider a horizontal\
    \ cylinder geometry, \nwith the periodic boundary condition in vertical direction\
    \ and zig-zag open edges. \nHere is an example of such geometry, given as an illustration\
    \ in LateX's verbatim environment\n\n\n\\begin{verbatim}\n\\    /    \\    / \n\
    \ A--B      A--B  \n/    \\    /    \\   \nB     A--B      A\n\\    /    \\  \
    \  /    \n A--B      A--B      \n/    \\    /    \\\nB     A--B      A  \n\\ \

    \ the number of sites in the vertical direction,\nand length L=3, again L being\
    \ the number of honeycomb lattice unit cells in the horizontal direction.\n\n\
    Let's call the number of \"empty\" sites divided by the total number of sites\
    \ on the edge the \"defect density\". \nAnswer following two questions. First,\
    \ In the limit of wide cylinders, what defect density leads to the highest number\
    \ of packed dimer configurations ?\nSecond, for XC-11 cylinder, what is the defect\
    \ density which gives the second highest number of packed dimer configurations\
    \ ?\n\nReturn your answer as two numbers, separated by a comma, in $\\boxed{}$\
