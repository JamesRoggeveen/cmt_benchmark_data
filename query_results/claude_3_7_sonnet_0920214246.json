Let's describe the action of SU(2) symmetry and lattice rotations: The SU(2) group acts on the tensors as $g(T) \\rightarrow W(g)_{pp'} U(g)_{uu'} U(g)_{ll'} U(g)_{dd'} U(g)_{rr'} T_{p'u'l'd'r'} = T_{puldr}$ with U and W being appropriate matrix representations of SU(2) group. The group of lattice rotations acts on T by permutation (clockwise or anticlockwise) of its virtual indices, i.e. rotation by 90 degrees clockwise corresponds to $R(-\\pi/2})(T_{puldr}) = T_{pruld}$. We choose the virtual spaces (indexed by u,l,d, and r) to be all identical and each composed from a direct sum of $V= 0 \\oplus 1$ i.e. a direct sum of trivial irrep of SU(2) and spin-1 irrep of SU(2). How many (real-valued) variational parameters would our TN wavefunction have ? That is, how many independent tensors T_{puldr}, transforming under A irrep of the C_4 group of rotations and invariant under SU(2) group do we need to consider ? Return your answer as a number in $\\boxed{}$ environment. Your final solution must be placed in a $\\boxed{}$ LaTeX environment.

    "prompt": "We are interested in counting fully packed dimer configurations on honeycomb lattice. Dimer can be placed on any of the nearest-neighbor bonds of the lattice and each site has to be a member of exactly one dimer. This is one of the ways to count ground state configurations of classical antiferromagnetic Ising model on triangular lattice. In particular, we want to consider a horizontal cylinder geometry, with the periodic boundary condition in vertical direction and zig-zag open edges. Here is an example of such geometry, given as an illustration in LateX's verbatim environment \\begin{verbatim} \\ / \\ / A--B A--B / \\ / \\ B A--B A \\ / \\ / A--B A--B / \\ / \\ B A--B A \\ / \\ / A--B A--B / \\ / \\ B A--B A \\end{verbatim} This is an XC-6 cylinder with width W=6, W being the number of sites in the vertical direction, and length L=3, again L being the number of honeycomb lattice unit cells in the horizontal direction. Let's call the number of \"empty\" sites divided by the total number of sites on the edge the \"defect density\". Answer following two questions. First, In the limit of wide cylinders, what defect density leads to the highest number of packed dimer configurations ? Second, for XC-11 cylinder, what is the defect density which gives the second highest number of packed dimer configurations ?
