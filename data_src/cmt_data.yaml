      The Hamiltonian for the Heisenberg model of three spin-1/2 arranged on a triangle, is $H=J(\boldsymbol{S}_1\cdot \boldsymbol{S}_2+\boldsymbol{S}_2\cdot \boldsymbol{S}_3+\boldsymbol{S}_3\cdot \boldsymbol{S}_1)$. What is the ground state energy E_0 and degeneracy D for antiferromagnetic coupling, i.e., $K>0$? Return your answer in a LaTeX environment of the form $\boxed{E_0;D}$

      The projected entangled pair states (PEPS) are a class of tensor network states that can be used to represent quantum many-body states. Given a PEPS with a tensor $T$ of bond dimension $D$ and physical dimension $d$ in a lattice of dimension $n$, the entanglement entropy of a region $A$ scales as $S_A \propto L^{\alpha}$ where $L$ is the linear size of the region $A$. What is the value of $\alpha$? Return your answer in a $\boxed{}$ LaTeX environment as a number.
